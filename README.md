# 10 Full Stack Projects
This contains list of full stack projects that you can build today. 

### How to use list ?
List contains description of each project in form of user story. You need to pick a project and start working on each user story.   
For Example -  
In voting app first you will create a basic project in your favourite framework. Then first user story is tells us to build a login registration feature in the app so we build that.Then next user story tells us to create a list or grid of polls which user will see upon opening the website. But for this you will first need to build the create poll feature which is in later `user story`.   
I hope now it is clear how to use the list. If any questions let me know.
